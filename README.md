# RTHumanMapTracking
Currently in Development
The objective of this project is to use 3D projection to visualize a room on a 2D space.
From a single viewpoint the 2D mapping should be able to track a human in realtime and translate 
their position in the 3D room onto the top-down 2D mapping of the room.
